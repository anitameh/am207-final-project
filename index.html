          In his 2012 State of the Union Address, President Obama said that the future income of U.S. children depended heavily on the quality of their K-12 teachers: "a good teacher [could]," in fact, "increase the lifetime income of a classroom by over $250,000." President Obama was referring to a paper that had been published just three months earlier by Harvard economists Raj Chetty and John Friedman, and Columbia Business School professor Jonah Rockoff. Chetty et al had measured the value-add (VA) of teachers - defined in terms of students' test scores - and utilized this information to quantify the impact that VA had on students' college attendance and projected income.

          The Equality of Opportunity Project (EOP) was born soon after from this research. Designed to study U.S. educational inequalities and their impact on future leaders, EOP was spearheaded by four economists from Harvard University and the University of California-Berkeley. In January 2014, two new works were published. They explored the effect of education, mean parent income, racial segregation and teenage pregnancy (among other features) on future relative and absolute mobility.

          The mobility metrics were couched in terms of children's projected mean income relative to other children in the same birth cohort. To summarize the conditional expectation of a child's rank given her parents' rank, Chetty et al performed a linear regression and defined "relative mobility" as the estimated slope. Then, given a percentile p of the national parent income distribution, the researchers were able to calculate the expected rank of children, i.e. the child's "absolute mobility at percentile p."
